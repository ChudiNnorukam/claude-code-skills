>
> ## What's Inside
>
> This free starter kit gives you battle-tested techniques for using Claude Code effectively. Each skill includes ready-to-use examples you can apply immediately.
>
> ## The 5 Skills
>
> ### 1. Smart Context Loading
>
> Feed Claude your entire codebase without hitting token limits.
>
> ```bash
> # Load project context efficiently
> claude "Read the project structure and understand the codebase"
>
> # Then ask specific questions with full context
> claude "Based on our codebase, what's the best way to add user authentication?"
> ```
>
> **Pro tip:** Start broad, then narrow. Let Claude build a mental model of your project first.
>
> ---
>
> ### 2. Test-Driven Prompting
>
> Write failing tests first, let Claude make them pass.
>
> ```bash
> # First, write the test
> claude "Write a test for a function that validates email addresses"
>
> # Then implement
> claude "Now implement the validateEmail function to pass these tests"
> ```
>
> **Why it works:** Tests give Claude clear success criteria and constraints.
>

>
> ### 3. Git-Aware Workflows
>
> Keep your commits clean with AI-assisted staging.
>
> ```bash
> # Review changes before committing
> claude "Review my staged changes and suggest a commit message"
>
> # Or let Claude help stage related changes
> claude "Which of my unstaged changes should be grouped into a single commit?"
> ```
>
> **Pro tip:** Use Claude to write conventional commit messages automatically.
>

>
> ### 4. Error Recovery Loops
>
> Automatically catch and fix runtime errors.
>
> ```bash
> # When you hit an error
> claude "I got this error: [paste error]. Help me debug and fix it."
>
> # Claude will:
> # 1. Analyze the error
> # 2. Check related code
> # 3. Propose and implement a fix
> ```
>
> **Key insight:** Give Claude the full error message and stack trace for best results.
>
> ---
>
> ### 5. Documentation Generation
>
> Turn code into docs in seconds.
>
> ```bash
> # Generate docs for a file
> claude "Write documentation for this module including examples"
>
> # Generate API documentation
> claude "Create OpenAPI/Swagger docs for these endpoints"
> ```
>
> **Pro tip:** Ask Claude to include usage examples - it makes docs actually useful.
